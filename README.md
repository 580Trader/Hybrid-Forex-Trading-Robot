# Hybrid Forex Trading Robot ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview & Goal

This project details the development of a hybrid Forex trading robot that combines a rules-based trading strategy with machine learning (AI) components. The core strategy is a customized **TRSS (Trend Reversal Structure Strategy)** designed to trade currency pairs like GBPUSD.

The primary goal is to create a more adaptive and robust automated trading system compared to purely rule-based or purely AI-driven approaches. By leveraging the consistency of rules and the pattern-recognition capabilities of AI, this project aims to solve challenges like static rule limitations in dynamic markets and the "black box" nature of some AI systems by creating a structured, yet intelligent, trading logic.

## Key Features & Current Status

The system is being built and refined component by component. The **core rules-based signal generation engine is now functionally complete** and undergoing iterative parameter tuning. The project is now moving into the **AI component development and backtesting phases.**

* **Data Ingestion & Preparation (`data_loader.py`):**
    * Loads historical D1 and H1 price data (OHLC, Volume) from CSV files.
    * Standardizes column names, handles datetime parsing, sets a DatetimeIndex, and localizes to UTC for consistency.
* **Technical Indicator Calculation (`indicators.py`):**
    * Calculates 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) for D1 trend filtering.
    * Calculates 14-period Average True Range (ATR) for H1 (used for Stop Loss calculation).
    * Calculates 10-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) for H1 (used for W/M pattern divergence).
* **D1 Market Structure Analysis (`trss_D1.py`):**
    * Identifies D1 Major Swing Highs (MSH) and Major Swing Lows (MSL) using a 3-candle pullback rule.
    * Determines D1 market structure ("Uptrend," "Downtrend," "Break of Structure" states) based on the sequence of these MSH/MSL points.
* **H1 Pattern Recognition (`patterns_H1.py`):**
    * Detects H1 W-Patterns (Double Bottoms) confirmed with Bullish RSI Divergence to generate buy signals.
    * Detects H1 M-Patterns (Double Tops) confirmed with Bearish RSI Divergence to generate sell signals.
    * *(Head & Shoulders patterns have been deferred to focus on W/M patterns for now).*
* **Rules-Based Signal Generation (`signal_engine.py`):**
    * Successfully combines the D1 market structure context (including the D1 50 SMA filter) with H1 entry patterns to generate preliminary "BUY\_RULE" and "SELL\_RULE" signals.
* **Risk Management Rules (`risk_rules.py`):**
    * Calculates Stop Loss (SL) based on H1 ATR from the signal candle's high/low plus a fixed pip offset.
    * Calculates a baseline Take Profit (TP) based on a 2:1 Risk:Reward ratio.
* **GUI Framework (by Brilliant Mpofu):**
    * A pre-existing user interface developed with Streamlit provides the foundation for visualizing market data, bot activity, and backtest results. Integration with the backend trading logic is a key future task.

## Preliminary Rules-Based Backtest Results

The following are initial backtest results for the **rules-based engine only** (before AI enhancement), run on the H1 training set data from **July 2021 to January 2024**. These results were generated from a specific set of H1 pattern parameters and are subject to change as parameter tuning continues. They provide a performance baseline to build upon.

* **Total Trades Simulated:** 100
* **Win Rate:** 37.37% (37 Wins / 62 Losses)
* **Total P&L:** +206.59 pips
* **Average Win:** +76.19 pips
* **Average Loss:** -43.37 pips
* **Realized Avg. Risk:Reward Ratio:** 1.76

*Note: These results do not include commissions or slippage.*

## My Development Process & Collaboration with Gemini

As the project lead, I am now personally driving the full development of the backend logic, AI components, and final system integration. Throughout this process, I have worked closely with Gemini, which has served as an AI coding partner and technical consultant.

* **Initial Vision & Architecture:** I established the foundational concept of a hybrid model, combining my trading knowledge of the TRSS strategy with AI enhancements, as outlined in my initial project proposal documents.
* **Iterative Development with Gemini:**
    * **Component-by-Component Build:** I've approached the project by breaking it down into manageable modules: data loading, indicators, D1 structure, H1 patterns, signal engine, and risk management.
    * **Providing Specifications:** For each module, I provided Gemini with specific requirements and detailed rules. This included indicator formulas, D1 swing point criteria, trend logic (my "1-2-3 movement" concept), Break of Structure (BoS) confirmation rules, H1 W/M pattern definitions, and SL/TP calculation rules.
    * **Code Generation and Adaptation:** Gemini assisted by providing initial Python code structures and function templates. I then integrated this code into my project's `.py` modules and adapted it as needed.
    * **Intensive Testing & Debugging in Jupyter Notebooks:** This has been a crucial part of my process. For each function, I load data, call functions, rigorously inspect outputs (using Pandas methods and `print` statements), and perform visual verification with Matplotlib against my manual chart analysis.
    * **Collaborative Troubleshooting:** Through this testing, I identify discrepancies or errors. I then work with Gemini by providing the error messages and context to collaboratively troubleshoot and receive revised code suggestions, which I then test again. This iterative loop has been central to our progress.
* **Defining AI Component Tasks:** I defined the roles for the K-Means and LSTM models within the hybrid system. I then collaborated with Gemini to create detailed, step-by-step task lists for the AI development phase, which I will now be implementing.
* **GUI Integration Planning:** I am planning the integration of the backend engine with the **Streamlit GUI framework initially developed by Brilliant Mpofu**. With Gemini's assistance, we've drafted an "Interface Contract" to define how the backend and GUI will communicate, which will guide this integration process.

## Current Status

**Active Development.** The core rules-based engine is functionally complete and generating preliminary trade signals with SL/TP levels. Current work involves the iterative parameter tuning of the rules-based logic (based on initial backtesting) and starting the development of the AI components (beginning with K-Means).

## Challenges & Learnings

* **Python Environment & Dependencies:** Overcame initial `pip install` failures due to SSL issues by using `--trusted-host` and managing virtual environments carefully.
* **Module Import Logic:** Debugged `sys.path` manipulation for importing custom modules from the `src` directory into Jupyter Notebooks.
* **Pandas DataFrame Operations:** Troubleshot `KeyError`s and subtle `pd.merge` issues by meticulously tracing DataFrame modifications to ensure column propagation through the data processing pipeline.
* **Iterative Pattern Recognition:** Developing Python functions for H1 W/M patterns that accurately reflect visual chart patterns is a highly iterative process requiring careful parameter tuning and extensive visual testing.
* **Translating Trading Concepts into Code:** Articulating nuanced trading rules (like multi-step BoS confirmation) into precise Python logic required detailed discussion and iterative refinement.

## Future Ideas

* Implement and test Head & Shoulders (H&S) / Inverse H&S H1 entry patterns.
* Build and integrate the K-Means market regime filter.
* Build and integrate the LSTM model for H1 entry confirmation and dynamic Take Profit.
* Implement `main_processor.py` to fully orchestrate the rules and AI components.
* Connect to the MT5 API for live data and potential trade execution.
* Conduct comprehensive backtesting of the full hybrid model using a dedicated library (e.g., `backtesting.py`).
* Further tune all strategy and AI parameters based on detailed backtesting results.
* **Complete the integration of the backend logic with the existing Streamlit GUI.**
* Explore XGBoost for additional confidence scoring if time permits.
* Implement more advanced trade management features like trailing stops or partial take profits.
